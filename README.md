# Fit-App (milestone project 3)

- We developed an application where users can log in and keep track of their workouts. The inspiration of this application was keeping our fitness on track.

## How to use
- Create an account and log in. After doing so you will be able to create workouts.
- You will be able to update and/or delete workouts that YOU have created.
- You are not authorized to update or delete workouts that you have NOT created.

## Technologies
- Back-end: Node Express
- Front-end: React
- Database: MongoDB
- Authentication / Authorization: json-web-token

## Outstanding bugs / unfinished functionality
- Deployed app does not work, runs into proxy request errors.
- Removed log out button because it was causing state errors.
- Wanted to add search functionality that filtered through workout names/tags.
